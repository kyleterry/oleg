# liboleg-http

Small libolegrary of ad-hoc functions imported from
[Mayo-Workbench](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/mayo-workbench). This library
is not even close to being on feature-parity with the upstream Oleg API, but
it'll let you do basic stuff. I plan on adding other things as they become
necessary.

## Installation

```
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

See examples subdirectory.
